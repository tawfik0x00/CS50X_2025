### **Suggested Next Step: Create a .gitignore**
I noticed in your `tree` output that you have compiled executable files (like `mario`, `hello`, `credit`) committed alongside your source code (`.c` files).

It is best practice **not** to upload these binaries to GitHub. I recommend creating a `.gitignore` file in your root folder:

1.  Create a file named `.gitignore`
2.  Add the following lines to it:

```text
# Ignore compiled executables
*.exe
*.out
*.o

# Ignore Mac system files (if applicable)
.DS_Store

# Ignore VS Code settings (optional)
.vscode/

# Specific executables from your tree (to be safe)
